# Deep Learning Playground 🎮

A playground of mini deep learning projects — from MNIST to NLP — built for practice and portfolio.  
The goal of this repository is to **learn by doing**, experiment with core deep learning concepts, and track progress step by step.

---

## 📂 Structure
Each project lives in its own folder and includes:
- A Jupyter/Colab notebook (`.ipynb`)
- A short `README.md` describing the project
- Notes, results, and key takeaways

---

## 🚀 Projects (in progress)
- **MNIST CNN Classifier** – Convolutional Neural Network for handwritten digit recognition  
- **Coming soon:** CIFAR-10 image classification  
- **Coming soon:** Simple text classification with RNN/LSTM  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo is not about achieving state-of-the-art benchmarks —  
it’s a **learning playground** to practice, improve, and demonstrate understanding of deep learning methods.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- PyTorch (for some projects)  
- Jupyter / Google Colab  

---

## 📌 Notes
This repository will grow over time as new experiments are added.  
Feel free to fork, explore, and use as inspiration for your own projects.
